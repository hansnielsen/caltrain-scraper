Scraper libraries / utility for Caltrain and 511 real-time departure data.

Runs on Ruby 2.0.0, and probably anything 1.9.3 or later.
Needs the following gems:
  nokogiri
  sequel (Caltrain only)
  curb (Caltrain only)
  timers (Caltrain only)
  rest_client (511 only)

Usage: "ruby ./scraper.rb"

Set SCRAPER_ENV="production" to run in scraper mode.
Otherwise, it'll run two quick scrapes and quit.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Ruby interpreter crashes after it's been running for several days
